        "Darkchatter will allow you to connect to discrete location based chat not hosted by a server.\n\n"

        "Darkchatter looks like a normal messaging app for usability.\n\n"

        "However the Magic happens under the hood. Instead of using the cellular or wifi networks, a message within a packet is sent from your phone to the surrounding area. People can then receive this packet if nearby and respond by sending their own packet broadcast to the area. Any Group chat created is done by the sharing of public key's using RSA encryption.  So you know your message will be safe from ill mannered individuals !\n\n"
